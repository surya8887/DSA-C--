# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. It is designed as a learning and reference resource for students, developers, and enthusiasts who want to deepen their understanding of fundamental computer science concepts through practical coding examples.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on different categories of data structures and algorithmic techniques:

- **Array/**: Implementations of various array-based problems and algorithms.
- **BinarySearch/**: Solutions and examples using binary search techniques.
- **LinkedList/**: Single and doubly linked list implementations and related algorithms.
- **Queue/**: Queue data structure implementations and applications.
- **Sliding-Windows/**: Algorithms using the sliding window technique.
- **Stack/**: Stack data structure implementations and related problems.
- **STL/**: Examples and usage of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
- **String/**: String manipulation algorithms and problems.
- **Tree/**: Tree data structures and algorithms (e.g., binary trees, binary search trees).

## Getting Started

To compile and run the C++ programs, you can use any standard C++ compiler such as `g++`. For example, to compile a program:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o program_name source_file.cpp
```

Then run the executable:

```bash
./program_name
```

Replace `program_name` and `source_file.cpp` with the appropriate names.

## Contribution

Contributions to improve the codebase, add new algorithms, or fix issues are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with clear descriptions of your changes.
